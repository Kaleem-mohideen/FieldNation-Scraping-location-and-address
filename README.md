For Developer
When you get into the profile, select all coverage area



Then select the tab “completed” as this assignment is just for completed projects…



Directions:
There’s about 2000 completed jobs completed in the profile and the assignment would be for you to export all the 2000 completed projects in an excel file and you will add two additional columns called



“Location where job is completed at” and The “address location”…You will extract this information into the new two columns…So the default report currently shows a total of 10 tabs when you export it, so you will be adding two additional columns..
